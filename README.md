## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/sidmandirwala/PostMinder.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   **Required `.env` Files**:
   - **Root `.env`**: Located at the project root.
   - **Server `.env`**: Located in the `server/` directory.
   - `BullMQ/.env` file is preconfigured and does not require changes for standard use.

   **Use `.example-env` Files**:
   - Each `.env` file has a corresponding `.example-env` file to guide setup.
   - Copy the templates and rename them to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .example-env .env
     cp server/.example-env server/.env
     ```

   **Populate `.env` Files**:
   - Fill the required values based on your application setup.
